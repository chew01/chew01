### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I like to make cool things. That's all there is to it.
*The more I learn the more I realise I don't know. Work more, talk less...*

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on reading and learning from textbooks, practising on LC/HR, freelancing on Fiverr.

ðŸ§  I have experience in Javascript/Typescript, Node.js, Java, Python, React, NoSQL (MongoDB), SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite3), Docker.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning /C++/Rust.

*Most of my work stuff are on private repos. Sorry*
