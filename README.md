### Hi there 👋

#### I like to make cool things. That's all there is to it.
*The more I learn the more I realise I don't know. Work more, talk less...*

🔭 I’m currently working on reading and learning from textbooks, practising on LC/HR, looking for projects.

🧠 I have experience in Javascript/Typescript, Node.js, React, NoSQL (MongoDB), SQL (PostgreSQL), Docker.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python/C++/Rust.
